# CNN From Scratch for Bangla Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch including the forward and backward propagation steps using numpy. The model is trained on a dataset of Bangla handwritten digits and achieves an accuracy of approximately 90% on the test dataset. Lenet architecture was used to train and predict the model. The learning
rate was tuned as 0.001, 0.005, and 0.01. Number of epochs was set to 25. Finally the best model was chosen to be the one which had maximum F1 score in validation data. The detailed results can be found in the `report.pdf` file. The training and validation loss and accuracy plots can be found in the `Logs` directory. The saved model can be found in the `Saved Model` directory.
